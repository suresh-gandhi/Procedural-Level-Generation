# Procedural-Level-Generation
In this project I have used Cellular Automata algorithm to generate random maps and then used Marching Squares algorithm to turn these maps into meshes(Levels) which can be used as gameobjects(stages or levels) in games. Everything occurs at runtime hence the level generation is dynamic in nature.
Every Mouse Click generates a new level and a player gameobject can be used to roam around the level with the help of arrow keys.
Made in Unity-5 and used C# language for scripting.
